# Space-Aliens
Space Invaders created in Java 👽


Description of the game:

Somewhere, in the endless cosmos, a war is taking place between 5 malicious aliens and a brave guardian of the planet Javac. You have to distroy all 5 space invaders. If they touch you, you'll die and the game will end. No extra lives (maybe in a future version).

Use left/right arrow keys for moving the guardian and space key for shooting the aliens. BAM!

Purpose: learning Java (and having fun)
